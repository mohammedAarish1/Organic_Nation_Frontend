      text: "Processed organic foods are products made from organically grown ingredients that have undergone various processing methods to create a final food product.

      header: "How can I identify  Processed Organic Foods?",
      text: "Processed organic foods can be identified by their labels, which indicate compliance with organic standards. Look for certifications from recognized organic bodies, such as the USDA Organic seal in the United States or the EU Organic logo in Europe. These labels ensure that the food is made from organic ingredients and processed according to organic guidelines. Additionally, processed organic foods often list their organic ingredients prominently on the packaging. However, they still undergo some level of processing, such as canning, freezing, or baking, which distinguishes them from fresh organic produce. Reading ingredient lists and certification labels is crucial in identifying these foods",

      header: "What is difference between Jaggery powder and Sugar?",
      text: "Jaggery powder and sugar differ primarily in their source and processing: Sugar is typically derived from sugarcane or sugar beets, while jaggery is made from sugarcane juice or palm sap. Sugar undergoes refining and chemical processing to extract sucrose, whereas jaggery is prepared by evaporating water from sugarcane juice or palm sap without separating the molasses. Jaggery has a distinctive caramel-like flavor due to the presence of molasses, whereas sugar is neutral in flavor. Jaggery is often considered healthier than sugar due to its mineral content and lower glycemic index, though both are still high in calories and should be consumed in moderation.",

      header: "How is organic Honey different from regular honey?",
      text: "Organic honey differs from regular honey primarily in its production methods and sourcing. Organic honey comes from bees that forage on flowers grown without synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers, ensuring a more natural and environmentally friendly process. Additionally, the beekeeping practices for organic honey emphasize sustainability, such as using organic-certified hives and avoiding artificial feed or chemicals. As a result, organic honey is often considered purer and is free from contaminants commonly found in conventional honey, making it a preferred choice for health-conscious consumers.",

      id: 7,
      header: "How is raw filtered honey different from processed honey?",
      text: `Raw Filtered Honey:- Raw filtered honey is extracted directly from the hive and only lightly filtered to remove debris like beeswax and dead bees. This process retains most of the natural enzymes, vitamins, and minerals. Because it undergoes minimal processing, raw honey retains more nutrients, including antioxidants, pollen, and propolis, which are beneficial for health. Processed Honey:- Processed honey undergoes heating and fine filtering, which removes impurities as well as beneficial components like pollen. It is often pasteurized to extend shelf life. heating and filtration process can destroy many of the beneficial enzymes, vitamins, and minerals found in raw honey, reducing its nutritional value.`,

      header: "How is rock salt healthier than conventional iodized salt?",
      text: "Rock salt, also known as Himalayan salt, is often perceived as healthier than conventional iodized salt due to several reasons: Rock salt is mined from natural salt deposits in the earth, whereas conventional table salt is typically heavily processed to remove impurities and often includes additives to prevent clumping. Himalayan rock salt is claimed to contain more minerals than table salt because it is less refined. These minerals include trace elements like potassium, magnesium, and calcium, which are believed to be beneficial for health in small amounts.",

      text: "Organic brown sugar is a type of sugar that is less refined than white sugar, retaining more of the natural molasses present in the sugarcane juice from which it is made. It is produced by crushing sugarcane to extract its juice, which is then evaporated and spun in a centrifuge to separate the molasses from the crystals.",
